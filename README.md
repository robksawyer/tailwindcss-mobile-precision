# Mobile Variant Plugin for Tailwind CSS

## Requirements

This plugin requires Tailwind CSS 1.2 or later.

## Installation

```bash
npm install tailwindcss-media-precision
```

## Usage

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    screens: ['responsive'],
  },
  plugins: [
    require('tailwindcss-media-precision'),
  ],
};
```

The above configuration would generate the following CSS:

```css

/* etc. */
```

Which you can then use in your HTML like this:

```html
UPDATE ME 
```

The above depends on the order of the generated CSS.
